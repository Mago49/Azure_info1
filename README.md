#  Azure Repository
This repository was created to communicate the benefits of Azure 
Scalability: Allows usage to be adjusted according to demand, thus controlling necessary costs.
It also allows you to scale when demand spikes, adding more CPUs or RAM to your virtual machine.

High availability: With SLAs very close to 100%, the level of certainty that your virtual machine will be available ensures that you are less vulnerable to external events. 

Elasticity: If demand suddenly increases or decreases, Azure will promptly make the necessary adjustments.

Reliability: Multiple regions of the world are covered by Azure, so even if something catastrophic happens in some region with its decentralized design, it will keep your machine running.

Predictability: Cloud predictability allows you to move forward with confidence, whether itâ€™s performance or cost. Both are influenced by the Microsoft Azure Well_Archtected Framework.
Security: The cloud provides several tools, and it is up to you to analyze which ones Azure can apply automatically and which ones we will apply manually.

Governance: Cloud-based auditing helps flag resources that are out of standard.
Depending on the operating model, software patches and updates can be applied automatically, which helps with security and governance.
You should establish a governance presence as soon as possible to keep your cloud up-to-date, secure, and well-managed.

Manageability: Cloud management is about managing your cloud resources. For example:
* Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
* Deploy resources based on a pre-configured template, removing the need for manual configuration.

Cloud management refers to how you manage your cloud environment and resources. For example:
* Through a web portal.
* Using a command line interface.
* Using APIs.
* Using Power Shell.
